"""Torch Berty Project

This module aims at bringing the power of bert to the masses with easy to use
entry point to train and get a production ready model.

Example:
    Examples can be given using either the ``Example`` or ``Examples``
    sections. Sections support any reStructuredText formatting, including
    literal blocks::

        $ python example_google.py

Section breaks are created by resuming unindented text. Section breaks
are also implicitly created anytime a new section starts.
